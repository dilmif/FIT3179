          <h2>World Happiness in 2023</h2>
          <p>This choropleth map represents happiness scores using a gradient of green shades, with darker green
            indicating higher scores and lighter green representing lower scores. Hover over any country to view its
            happiness score.
            <br><br>
            Nordic European countries such as Finland, Norway, and Sweden appear in dark green on the map, signifying
            that they have some of the highest happiness scores globally.
            <br><br>
            In contrast, African and Asian countries, such as Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, tend to appear in lighter
            green on the map, indicating lower happiness scores. These regions often face challenges related to economic
            hardship, political instability, and lower access to basic services, all of which can impact happiness and
            life satisfaction.

          <p>
            This box plot showcases global happiness disparities and diverse well-being levels across continents.
            <br><br>
            Europe stands out with the highest median happiness score and maximum score, closely followed by North
            America and South America. The data of these continents is tightly clustered with minimal spread, reflecting
            its high overall well-being. In contrast, Asia and Oceania exhibit more variation, exemplified by outliers.
            Africa presents the lowest median happiness score and the widest spread, emphasizing the challenges faced by
            many African nations in achieving well-being.

          <h2>World Happiness vs GDP Per Capita</h2>
          <p>This bubble chart highlights the correlation of higher GDP per Capita with higher happiness score. Each
            circle represents a country, with a colour matching their continent and a bubble size representing its
            population. 
            <br><br>
            Overall, European countries, represented by green bubbles, are in the top right corner indicating high GDP
            per Capita and high happines score. Luxembourg is shown to have the highest GDP per Capita, and Finland is
            shown to have the highest happiness score.
            <br><br>
            In the bottom left corner, there are primarily more African countries, indicated by red bubbles. Sierra Leone is seen to have the lowest GDP per Capita, and Afghanistan is seen to have the lowest happiness Score.
            <br><br>
            Hover over any bubble to see information about the country, its continent, happiness score, GDP per Capita and population. Select a continent you want to see in particular, and drag the slider to show countries with a population greater than what you have chosen.

          <h2>Various Key Indicators Related to Happiness</h2>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div class="description">
          <p>These small multiple bar charts represent indicators related to happiness. These factors include GDP per Capita, freedom, social support, generosity and life expectancy.
            The scores for these categories were calculated using survey data.
            <br><br>Notably, Europe scores highly in each category, having the highest mean value for GDP per Capita, social support and life expectancy. 
            Conversely, North America and South America share similarities in their scores, especially when it comes to GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy and generosity. 
           </p>

      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div class="description">
          <p>However, both continents record relatively lower generosity scores, highlighting an individualistic community. On the other hand, Africa, Asia and Oceania score highly in generosity. Asia scoring the highest underscores a profound sense of community support and sharing. 
            Africa, while scoring the lowest in all other components, has a high score in generosity. This illustrates the strong collectivistic culture, compared to the individualistic culture in North and South America.
